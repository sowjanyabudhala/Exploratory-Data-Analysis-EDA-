## 🚢 Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to understand the variables influencing survival and to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset available from Kaggle or other public sources.

## Key Features:
PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked

## 🧪 EDA Objectives
Generate Summary Statistics

Mean, median, standard deviation, min, max for numerical features.

## Visualize Distributions

Histograms and boxplots to explore value distributions and outliers.

## Understand Relationships

Pairplots and correlation matrices to examine relationships between features.

## Identify Patterns & Anomalies

Analyze skewed features, outliers, missing data, and unique patterns.

## Feature-Level Inferences

Derive meaningful insights such as survival by class, age group, gender, family size, embarkation port, etc.

## 📊 Key Visualizations
Histograms & KDE plots for continuous features (e.g., Age, Fare)

Boxplots to detect outliers

Countplots for categorical features like Pclass, Sex, Embarked

Heatmap of correlation matrix

Survival analysis using group-wise plots (e.g., survival by sex, class, age)

## 💡 Key Insights
Most passengers had Parch = 0 (no parents/children aboard)

Majority of passengers embarked at Southampton

Survival rates were higher for:

Females

First-class passengers

Children (lower age)

The Ticket feature is categorical despite containing numbers

The dataset contains missing values in features like Age, Cabin, and Embarked

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
Python

google colab

Pandas, NumPy
